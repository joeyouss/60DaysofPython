As you start to walk through the codes, we use the following guides, styles and IDE
1. IDE- PyCharm. Download link - https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
2. For styling of python code, we use the PEP 8 guidelines (already embedded in PyCharm) - read them here- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#:~:text=PEP%208%20--%20Style%20Guide%20for%20Python%20Code,%2005-Jul-2001%2C%2001-Aug-2013%20%202%20more%20rows%20


Each code walks from intermediate to advanced level project taking roughly about 60 days given one project per day.
These projects are not at very beginner level and you might want to learn some of them.
